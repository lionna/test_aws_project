# Task 2.2

Used [AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-construct-library.html)
1) Created new folder, for example 'cdk'
2) Installed 
* `npm install -g aws-cdk`
3) Configured 
* `cdk init app --language csharp`

 (
    delete options: 
    * `aws cloudformation describe-stacks`
    * `aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name CdkStack --region eu-central-1`
    * `aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name CdkStack --retain-resources shopwebappbucket4BE87B22`
    * `aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name CDKToolkit`
    * `npm uninstall -g aws-cdk`
)
4) Added new options to CdkStack.cs and Program.cs
# core for AWS CDK (Program.cs)
```csharp
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    var app = new App();
    new CdkStack(app, "CdkStack", new StackProps
    {
        Env = new Environment
        {
            Account = "ACCOUNT_ID",
            Region = "eu-central-1",
        }
    });
    app.Synth();
}
```
# CdkStack.cs
```csharp
internal CdkStack(Construct scope, string id, IStackProps props = null) : base(scope, id, props)
{
    // Create the S3 bucket
    var bucket = new Bucket(this, $"{BucketId}-bucket", new BucketProps
    {
        ...
    });

    var oai = new OriginAccessIdentity(this, "OAI");

    // Create an IAM policy statement to allow GetObject action on the S3 bucket
    var bucketPolicyStatement = new PolicyStatement(new PolicyStatementProps
    {
        ...
    });

    bucket.AddToResourcePolicy(bucketPolicyStatement);

    // Create CloudFront distribution
    var distribution = new CloudFrontWebDistribution(this, $"{BucketId}-distribution", new CloudFrontWebDistributionProps
    {
        OriginConfigs = new[]
        {
          ...
        }
    });

    // Deploy files to the S3 bucket
    new BucketDeployment(this, $"{BucketId}-deployment", new BucketDeploymentProps
    {
        ...
    });

    // Export CloudFront distribution ID
    new CfnOutput(this, "DistributionURL", new CfnOutputProps
    {
        Value = distribution.DistributionDomainName,
        Description = "CloudFront distribution"
    });

    // Output S3 bucket URL
    new CfnOutput(this, "BucketURL", new CfnOutputProps
    {
        Value = bucket.BucketWebsiteUrl,
        Description = "The URL of the S3 bucket website endpoint"
    });
}
```

5) Builded C# project
* `dotnet build src` compile this app
* `cdk deploy`       deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`         compare deployed stack with current state

    }
7) Result of operation  'cdk deploy --all'
[Settings] (img.png)
8) Checked links:
[S3 bucket link](http://shop-web-app-automated.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/) - the 403 error should be shown
[Cloud Front link](https://d3oeh93tzbcw2m.cloudfront.net/) - should be available.


# Task 3

Task: https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/aws/blob/main/aws-developer/03_serverless_api/task.md

### Task 4.3
1. Created `createProduct` Lambda function:
   - Triggered by HTTP POST method.
   - Implements logic to create a new item in `products` table.

2. Curl:

  https://s0ob4l26k9.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/products \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "title": "some new title",
    "description": "some new description",
    "price": 11,
    "count": 22
  }'


### Task 4.4
1. Committed changes to new branch

### Additional Tasks
- **Error Handling**:
  - Implemented error handling:
    - Returns 400 status code for invalid product data.
    - Returns 500 status code for any unhandled errors.
  
- **Logging**:
  - Added console.log for each incoming request and their arguments.

- **Transactions**:
  - Implemented transaction-based creation of products and stocks to ensure data integrity.

### Task 5.3
1. Created a Lambda function `importFileParser` to handle S3 events.
2. The function is triggered by `s3:ObjectCreated:*` events.
